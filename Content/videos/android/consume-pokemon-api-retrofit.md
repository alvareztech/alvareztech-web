Tutorial to create a Pokédex app from scratch. The app uses Retrofit library to consume an API on Android. In addition to using Glide to download images.

__What you'll learn__

* Consume an API or Web Service with Retrofit
* Use a `RecyclerView` component in grid mode
* Handle `RecyclerView` events

__What you'll need__

* [Know how to obtain images with _Glide_](/videos/android/descargar-imagenes-glide/)

## Introduction

__API (0:22)__

* [pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co/)

__Google Chrome Extension (1:10)__

* [JSON Formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa)

### Images (1:47)

URL to obtain the images of the pokemon by their number.

```html
̶h̶t̶t̶p̶s̶:̶/̶/̶p̶o̶k̶e̶a̶p̶i̶.̶c̶o̶/̶m̶e̶d̶i̶a̶/̶s̶p̶r̶i̶t̶e̶s̶/̶p̶o̶k̶e̶m̶o̶n̶/̶2̶5̶.̶p̶n̶g̶
```

__Update:__ The previous URL stopped working but you can get the image directly from the repository like this:

```html
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/25.png
```

Pikachu is the pokemon number 25.

## Retrofit

2:02: Dependency to use *Retrofit* in the module `build.gradle`

```groovy
c̶o̶m̶p̶i̶l̶e̶ ̶'̶c̶o̶m̶.̶s̶q̶u̶a̶r̶e̶u̶p̶.̶r̶e̶t̶r̶o̶f̶i̶t̶2̶:̶r̶e̶t̶r̶o̶f̶i̶t̶:̶2̶.̶1̶.̶0̶'̶
```

__Update:__ `compile` is _deprecated_ and there are new versions.

```groovy
implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.7.1'
```
